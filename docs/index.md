# Rarible Protocol

Rarible Multichain Protocol is a decentralized toolset that simplifies the way developers can work with NFTs. Protocol builds an abstraction layer for several blockchains and isolates the developer from their specifics with Multichain SDK.

## Features

* Look for NFT collection
* Find NFTs related to owner/creator
* Sell your newly minted NFTs
* Buy NFTs
