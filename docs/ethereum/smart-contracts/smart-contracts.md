# Smart Contracts Overview

Rarible Smart Contracts for Ethereum consist of:

* [Exchange V2](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/tree/master/exchange-v2) — purchase and sale of tokens
* [Tokens, TokenFactories](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/tree/master/tokens) — tokens contracts and Token Factories
* [RoyaltiesRegistry](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/tree/master/royalties-registry) — embedded royalties in NFT
* [RoyaltiesProviders](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/tree/master/royalties) — commissions getting from individual contracts
* [TransferProxy](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/tree/master/transfer-proxy) — token exchange according of the type
* [Staking](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/tree/master/staking) — tokens deposit in exchange for raising points. That makes it possible to take an active part in solving DAO issues
* [Auctions](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/tree/RPC-107-Auction/auction ) — fixed-bid auction
* OnChainOrders — will be added to ExchangeV2 soon
